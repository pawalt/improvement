# Improvement

This project aims to track my personal improvements each week. By making one small change each week, I hope to make a large change over time.

# Week 1 - Tasking
## 3/10 - 3/16
### Motivation

I think keeping a strong tasking system is the foundation for a reliable overall workflow in life. Tasking has two main components - tasks and timing. Tasks are obviously important for keeping track of what needs to get done next. For me, timing helps me focus on what needs to be done at the current moment and not get distracted by other things.

### Tools
#### Todoist

I'll be using Todoist to keep track of all my tasks.

#### Clockify

I'll be using clockify with its Todoist integration to time all my tasks.

### Rules

- All school-related and learning-related work goes into Todoist
- Any time spend > 10 minutes on a task must be tracked with Clockify
- Check Todoist each morning before class and each night before bed
- Reach Todoist Zero each night

# Week 2 - Workouts
## 3/17 - 3/23
### Reflection

This week was overall good, but I didn't hold up to some of what I wanted to do. I didn't check Todoist in the morning, and the time tracking didn't help keep me on task like I thought it would. That said, I got to Todoist zero every night, and I was very good about putting my tasks into Todoist. I also switched from Clockify to Forest halfway through, and that helped immensely. Forest makes me actually put down my phone and not go to distracting websites, which was fantastic.

I will continue to use Todoist and Forest in conjunction.

### Motivation

With living a busy life come many excuses to not work out, but I need to work harder to work out more. Working out measurable improve cognitive function and overall happiness.

### Tools

N/A

### Rules

- Must exercise 5 times/week (cardio minimum 30 min, weights minimum 45 min)
- Must do 60 push ups each day (probably 30 morning, 30 night)

# Week 3 - Break
## 3/24 - 3/30
### Reflection
Exercising last week felt great. It also wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I expected to be stressed for time, but basically instead of relaxing and watching YouTube videos sometimes, I watched YouTube while going on the stationary bike. The push ups also felt great to get in. I definitely feel stronger in the chest, even in this short time. Tasking is also going very well.

### Motivation

I've got an insanely busy week, so I'm not going to add anything on. See you next week!

# Week 4 - Screen Time
## 3/31 - 4/6
### Reflection

Last week was crazy. Thankfully, I'm done now, and I can get to another improvement.

### Motivation

There is a lot coming out right now about how apps intentionally engineer themselves to make them more addictive, and the tactics definitely work on me. I want to cut our or significantly reduce the impact these apps have on my life.

### Tools

- Siempo
- Quality Time
- More TBD

### Rules

- Use Siempo the whole week
- Check Quality Time reports every morning
- More TBD

# Week 5 - Blogging
## 4/7-4/13
### Reflection

I started off last week really strong, but I got weak towards the end. I started to use my phone a ton more, and I learned how to game Siempo. Instead of doing long, infrequent social media sessions, I could just do short, frequent social media sessions. These short, infrequent sessions in many ways were worse. For now, I'm not going to change anything, but if this behavior pattern continues, I will add more screen time-limiting apps.

### Motivation

I haven't blogged in a while, but when I do blog, I love it. It doesn't take too long, and it's very rewarding.

### Tools

- Github pages

### Rules

- Make one post a week

# Week 6 - Note-taking
## 4/14-4/20
### Reflection

Writing that blog post was great. Blogs really help me formalize my thoughts, and I enjoy putting what I have to say out there. I've been doing very well on all my tasks except the workout task. This week, I'm really going to focus on getting in solid workouts and doing my push-ups.

### Motivation

I've gotten used to not taking notes over the years, but in particularly my Physics and Linear Algebra classes, this is coming back to bite me. There are simply too many methods and formulas to remember in my head, so I need to take better notes.

### Tools

- Rocketbook

### Rules

- Take notes in Rocketbook each Physics and Math class
- Scan in new notes each night into Rocketbook

# Week 7 - Refocusing
## 4/21-4/27
### Reflection

Things went decently with notes last week but not as well as I hoped. I've added so many things over the past few weeks that I haven't had the chance to fully implement any of them. I'm going to take this week to to focus on fully implementing the things I have over the last week.

### Motivation

N/A

### Tools

N/A

### Rules

Focus on the rules from the past weeks, particularly note-taking and workout

# Week 9 - Budgeting
## 4/21-4/27
### Reflection

As you can see, I took an extra week to work on the goals I had already set. I'm doing well on the goals that I've kept. For reference, I'm still doing the following:

- Keeping track of tasks with Todoist
- Focusing with Forest
- Blogging weekly
- Using Siempo & QualityTime (this has cut my phone usage in half!)

The only real thing missing is note-taking. I realized while taking notes that I learn much better if I just listen, so that's what I'm doing now.

### Motivation

Now that I have a job, I've been spending money a big more carelessly than I should. I want to cut back so I can make sure the extra money goes into my pocket, not into Wawa's.

### Tools

- Intuit Mint

### Rules

Nothing for now other than check in on what my Mint spending patterns look like at the end of the week.
