# Improvement 2

In the summer of 2019, [I spent a few weeks](https://pawa.lt/posts/2019/05/constant-improvement-a-reflection/) making one life improvement each week and reflecting on it the following week. You can see those in `old.md`. I really liked this! Making small improvements each week let me make tangible improvements to myself without overburdening myself.

The main problem with this method was the requirement that I make an improvement each week. **I think the valuable part of this system was not the improvement but the feedback loop.** I fall out of habits when I don't have a feedback loop to force me to continue them. Reflecting each week and making changes based on the reflection was an extremely valuable process for me.

Separately, I really like CPG Grey's idea of [themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE). I think the broad brush used to inform decisions is very valuable.

## Method

**My theme for this round of improvement will be Intentionality.** Each week, I will reflect on how I'm doing on being intentional in daily life, and I'll make small changes to point me in the direction of being more intentional. This does not require that I make a new improvement each week. I may tweak a past improvement, add a new one, remove one altogether, or something else.

I'll run this round of improvement for the CPG Grey recommended length of 1 season. This will end when winter ends, Sunday March 20, 2022.

## Week 1 (1/2-1/8)

### Motivation

I like social media. I get value out of Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. What I don't like is the habits I've developed around them. When my brain has idle time, I immediately scroll over and hit those buttons. I get no value out of those interactions - frequently I click on those apps, and I see no new posts. I'd like to get value out of the apps but break the impulse clicking habit.

I want to be intentional about how I use social media.

### Method

I will use the [Opal](https://www.opal.so/) app to block out all social media except from 7pm - 8pm every day. This will allow me to get the value out of my social media but kill the impulse clicking habit.
